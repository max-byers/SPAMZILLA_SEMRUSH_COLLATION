How is spring water collected? | Cairns Natural Spring Water

Spring water is nature’s refreshing gift, quenching our thirst with its purity and pristine taste. But have you ever wondered how this liquid gem is collected? Below, we’ll take you on the journey exploring the fascinating process of spring water collection, revealing the steps that bring it from its source to our bottles.
The first step in collecting spring water is identifying the source itself. Springs are typically found in areas where underground water rises to the surface, creating a natural flow. Geological surveys and hydrologists play a vital role in pinpointing these hidden treasures. They assess various factors like terrain, geology, and rainfall patterns to locate springs that exhibit promising characteristics for collecting high-quality water. Our water is bottled directly from the source right here in Cairns.
Preserving the purity of the spring water source is crucial. Once identified, measures are taken to safeguard the surrounding environment from potential contamination. Strict land management practices and conservation efforts are implemented to maintain the integrity of the spring and its surrounding ecosystem. This includes protecting the land from pollution, ensuring there are no nearby industrial or agricultural activities that could compromise the water’s quality.
To collect spring water, specialised infrastructure is installed at the source. Wells or boreholes are constructed to access the underground water reservoirs feeding the spring. Pipes or conduits are carefully inserted into the wells, allowing the water to flow naturally to the surface. Gravity is often utilized as the primary force to guide the water, avoiding the need for excessive pumping. This gentle extraction process helps maintain the natural properties and mineral composition of the spring water, ensuring its freshness.
Once collected, the spring water undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets strictquality standards. It is analysed for a wide range of parameters, including pH level, mineral content, and microbiological purity. If necessary, treatment methods such as filtration or UV disinfection may be employed to further enhance the water’s safety and taste, while still preserving its natural qualities. These measures ensure that every sip you take from abottle of spring wateris not only refreshing but also free fromcontaminants.
At Cairns Natural Spring Water, we have invested in state-of-the-art machinery that allows us to bottle water for you in sterile and hygienic conditions. Our water is pure and unadulterated – nothing is added or taken away. It is as clean and fresh in the bottle as it is in the underground aquifer from which it is drawn.
