DEA Waterbodies
Find water across the country
Locate over 300,000 waterbodies across Australia and look back at their changes over three decades with Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Waterbodies. Monitor critical lakes and dams, including hard-to-reach waterbodies in remote areas and on large properties.
Explore the online map to find all waterbodies larger than 2,700 sq m (three Landsat satellite image pixels) that are present more than 10% of the time.
Download the data to identify when waterbodies have increased or decreased their wet surface area, informing plans for the future.
DEA Waterbodies defines polygon boundaries around the significant water areas of Western Australia’s Lake Carnegie, revealing changes in wet area within each polygon over time.
