Add plants and decorations to your water fountain to add visual interest and provide a habitat for wildlife. Choose plants and decorations that are suitable for the specific conditions of your water fountain, and be sure to follow proper planting and care instructions.
Protect the Water Fountain from the Elements:
Use a cover or shelter to protect your water fountain from the elements, such as a tarp or gazebo. This will help to prevent debris from entering the water and will protect the water fountain from extreme weather conditions.
Follow Safety Guidelines:
Follow proper safety guidelines to ensure the safety of yourself and others around your water fountain. This includes supervising children and pets, and never diving or jumping into the water.
