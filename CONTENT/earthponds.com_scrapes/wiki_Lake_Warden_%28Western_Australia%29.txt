Lake Warden
is a
salt lake
in the
Goldfields-Esperance
region of
Western Australia
.  It and its associated wetlands are protected in a
nature reserve
; they were recognised as being of international importance under the
Ramsar Convention
through designation of the Lake Warden System on 7 June 1990 as Ramsar Site 485.

The lake is also a
DIWA-listed wetland
.

Location
[
edit
]
The lake is about 5 kilometres (3 mi) north of
Esperance
, between the two main access roads to the town, the
South Coast
and
Coolgardie-Esperance Highways
.  It lies in the
Esperance Plains
IBRA
bioregion
, and in the Esperance Lakes Nature Reserve.

Lake Warden was so named in 1848 by the explorer
John Septimus Roe
in recognition of  Lady
Ann Warden Spencer
, wife of Sir
Richard Spencer
,  the Government Resident in
Albany
, for whom the nearby Lake Spencer (now known as
Pink Lake
) was named.
Description
[
edit
]
The lake has an average depth of 2 metres (6 ft 7 in), which has been slowly increasing since recording first began in 1979.  The average depth of the lake is now more than 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) higher than it was, mostly as a result of
deforestation
that has led to a greater amount of
run-off
.

As well as Lake Warden itself, the 2,000-hectare (4,900-acre) Ramsar site includes the associated system of
saline
lakes and
marsh
areas behind beach-front
dunes
.  The Lake Warden system is
hydrologically
complex with seven main lakes and over 90 smaller lakes creating diverse wetland habitats.  As well as Warden, significant lakes in the system include Windabout,
Woody
, Station, Mullet and Wheatfield Lakes.
[

]
The catchment for the lake covers an area of 212,000 hectares (523,863 acres) of which 80% is agricultural land, of which 95% has been
cleared
.

Flora and fauna
[

Saltwater paperbark
trees grow the water's edge in all the wetlands.
sedges
and
rushes
also grow around the shoreline in the tree zone.  Other trees include
stout paperbark
and
red-eyed wattle
blending into low
woodland
of
showy banksia
or
mallee
eucalypts
. At the eastern end of the wetland system the trees are replaced by
samphire
, especially
Tecticornia
and
Sarcocornia
species.  Higher parts of the marsh are dominated by the grass
Stipa luncifolia
while
austral seabite
occurs in areas fed by springs.

The site regularly supports up to 20–30,000
waterbirds
. Numerically significant species include the
Australian shelduck
,
black swan
,
chestnut teal
,
grey teal
,
freckled duck
,
musk duck
,
pink-eared duck
,
hardhead
,
banded stilt
,
hoary-headed grebe
,
Australian pelican
and
yellow-billed spoonbill
.  The system also supports an important population of the
hooded plover
.  The global population of this
threatened
Australian
endemic
species is less than 10,500 individual birds, while the Western Australian population numbers less than 6000.  Over 240 hooded plovers have been recorded on one occasion at Lake Warden, constituting 2.4% of the global population and 4% of the Western Australian population.  The
Recherche Cape Barren goose
, listed as
vulnerable
under the
Commonwealth
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
, was recorded at Lake Warden Nature Reserve in surveys undertaken in 1981–85.
[

]
The lake has been identified by
BirdLife International
as an
Important Bird Area
(IBA) because it has supported over 1% of the world populations of hooded plovers, musk ducks, and sometimes banded stilts.
