Castlereagh Waterhole
[
edit
]
The name
Gilgandra
came from
Aboriginal
word for the area, and means "long waterhole".
[
10
]
The water level in the Castlereagh River is variable and the wide, sandy riverbed is frequently dry, or is reduced to a small stream.
[
11
]
However, there was a large permanent waterhole in the river, 100 yards (91 m) long and 12 feet (3.7 m) deep, near where the township developed, and for many years subsequently.
[
12
]
It was the source of the town's name.
Windmills and Artesian Water
[
edit
]
Gilgandra is situated above the subterranean water of the
Great Artesian Basin
(GAB) and, specifically, over the Surat Sub-basin of the GAB.
[
13
]
Artesian water occurs where porous rocks below the surface, called aquifers, store and carry water underground. When bores are sunk to reach the aquifers, windmills can draw the water to the surface to be stored in tanks.
[
14
]
Well over a hundred years ago, windmills were being used by townspeople to access Gilgandra's fresh, drinkable artesian water for their households, and by farmers to obtain water for their stock.
[
15
]
Windmills were being advertised in the first Gilgandra newspapers in 1905, with several local people selling and installing them, including plumber Bill Hitchen, later famous for organising the
1915 Cooee march
.
[
16
]
From the early 20th century, locals and others referred to Gilgandra as a "town of windmills", and many references to that can be found.
[
17
]
In 1948, it was reported that there were over 300 windmills in Gilgandra.
[
18
]
Many can still be seen dotted around the town but few are now in use. The Gilgandra Shire Council built a reticulated water supply in 1966, reducing reliance on private windmills. The council draws on artesian water, operating a network of nine bores to supply water to Gilgandra.
[
19
]
In 2016 Gilgandra had the largest single annual licensed entitlement to water from the Great Artesian Basin of any shire council in NSW, at 2,020 megalitres.

History
[
edit
]
Before the European
squatters
took up pastoral runs in the 1830s,
[
21
]
the Gilgandra region was home to three Aboriginal language groups: the
Gamilaraay
,
Wiradjuri
and
Wayilwan
.
[
22
]
According to archaeological evidence cited in the
Warrumbungle National Park
guidebook, indigenous groups are believed to have lived to the east of Gilgandra for at least 25,000 years, and in the
Warrumbungle Ranges
, 70 kilometres to the north, for about 17,000 years.
[
23
]
Gilgandra was proclaimed as a town in 1888, and the first town blocks were sold in 1889. While that was an impetus to growth, the area had been settled by a Europeans for many years before that. Gilgandra's Post Office was formally established in 1867, a local school had opened in 1881, and the first hearings were held in the Gilgandra court house in 1884. The Gilgandra Shire was constituted in 1906.
[
24
]
On 20 July 1900, an indigenous man,
Jimmy Governor
, murdered four members of the Mawbey family, and the children's governess, at their farming property just east of Gilgandra, in the area of Breelong. He was working as a fencing contractor for Mr Mawbey. The story of the murders received great publicity at the time.
[
25
]
[
26
]
It was revived 1972 as the basis of a fictional work by
Thomas Keneally
,
The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith
.
[
27
]
During
World War I
, a
recruitment march
to Sydney began in Gilgandra, known as the Coo-ee March. The men who enlisted on the way became known locally as "Coo-ees". The march was given its name because the marchers shouted the old bush call of "
cooee
"  at each town along their journey to attract recruits. Twenty-six men left Gilgandra on 10 October 1915. At each town on the route, the marchers were feted and a recruitment meeting was held. By the time they reached
Sydney
, just over one month later on Friday 12 November 1915, the number of recruits had swelled to 263.
[
28
]
[
29
]
They were welcomed on arrival in Sydney with huge crowds lining George Street near the Town Hall to welcome them and an official address given to them by the Minister for Works representing the
Premier of New South Wales
.
[
30
]
in 1919, as a peace thanksgiving, parishioners of St Ambrose Church in
Bournemouth
, England, grateful for the assistance England had received from the
Dominions
in defending the British Empire, decided to gift £1,200 to the town in the Empire with a good church and wartime service record. Gilgandra was chosen and the money funded the construction of
St Ambrose Church, Gilgandra
, which commenced in 1920.

Inventors
[
edit

Arthur Clifford Howard, known as "Cliff", (1893–1971), inventor of the rotary hoe (a version of a
cultivator
), whose father John Howard moved in 1908 from Crookwell to a property named "Mountain View" at Biddon near Gilgandra. In 1912 when his father introduced a steam tractor engine to his farm Cliff Howard had the idea of applying the tractor's power to blades that would turn the soil instead of compacting it as a pulled plough did. In 1912 Howard created and tested the prototype of his invention on "Mountain View", leading to his patenting the rotary hoe in 1919.

Notes
[
edit
]
^
A maximum temperature of 36.1 °C (97.0 °F) was recorded in Gilgandra on 30 July 1961, but this temperature is noted as being "wrong" in a reference work on temperature extremes.
[
32
]
It also does not appear in the Bureau of Meteorology's official
extremes list for July in New South Wales
, where the highest temperature is listed as 31.8 °C (89.2 °F). The given value for the highest maximum temperature for July in the table of 23.9 °C (75.0 °F) on 22 July 1946 is thus derived from a
table of highest maximum temperatures for each month
from the Bureau of Meteorology, excluding the 1961 temperature.
