The
Lakes Argyle and Kununurra Ramsar Site
comprises an extensive system of artificial
freshwater
reservoirs, with their associated permanent
wetlands
, formed by damming the
Ord River
in the eastern part of the
Kimberley
region of northern
Western Australia
.  The reservoirs include
Lake Argyle
and
Lake Kununurra
.  There are numerous endemic plants and a rich fauna.  The 1,500 km
2
(580 sq mi) site was designated a wetland of international importance under the
Ramsar Convention
on 7 June 1990, making it Ramsar Site 478.

The
diversion dam
on the Ord River was completed in 1963 as the first stage of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme.  It flooded the Ord valley upstream towards the site of the Argyle Dam, creating Lake Kununurra and subsidiary wetlands such as Lily Creek Lagoon and the Packsaddle Swamps.  The Argyle Dam was completed in 1972 as the second stage of the scheme, creating Lake Argyle.  The town of
Kununurra
was built at the site of the diversion dam, adjoining Lake Kununurra and Lily Creek Lagoon.  Human use of the area includes
irrigated
tropical agriculture
,
diamond mining and exploration
, and with tourism becoming increasingly important.

Flora and fauna
[

Water levels in Lake Argyle fluctuate annually by about 3 metres (9.8 ft) but those in Lake Kununurra and its associated wetlands are kept constant except for short periods when levels are lowered to control weed growth.  There are dead trees throughout the wetland system which were killed by permanent flooding following dam construction.  The lakes are deep and there are large areas of open water without aquatic plants. The large fluctuation in water levels in Lake Argyle has prevented vegetation establishment along most of the shoreline.  However, because water levels are stable in Lake Kununurra and its associated wetlands, they have developed densely vegetated margins, with aquatic plants fringed by
bulrushes
,
grassland
and
savanna
woodland
. Tree species found on the wetland margins include
broad-leaved paperbark
,
Eucalyptus microtheca
,
river red gum
,
Nauclea orientalis
,
Sesbania formosa
and
Lophostemon grandiflorus
.

The lakes form an important
dry season
refuge for
waterbirds
, with regular numbers of over 20,000 and sometimes of up to 200,000 individuals.  Lake Argyle contains some of the largest aggregations of waterbirds in northern Australia.  Abundant species include
glossy ibis
(with up to 6,000 counted),
magpie goose
(10,500),
wandering whistling duck
(11,000),
plumed whistling duck
(4,300),
radjah shelduck
(900),
Pacific black duck
(16,000),
grey teal
(17,200),
pink-eared duck
(1,800),
hardhead
(51,400),
green pygmy goose
(1,500) and
Eurasian coot
(50,000).  The two lakes are a stronghold of the
comb-crested jacana
.  Over 200 terrestrial and aquatic bird species have been recorded in the area, which also supports several kinds of
microbats
, the
little red
and
black flying-foxes
,
rakali
, and large numbers of
freshwater crocodiles
.
