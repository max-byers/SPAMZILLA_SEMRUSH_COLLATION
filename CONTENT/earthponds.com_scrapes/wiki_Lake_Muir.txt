Location
Interactive map of Lake Muir
Lake Muir
is a
freshwater lake
, with a larger surrounding
wetlands
area, that is located in the
South West
region of
Western Australia
. The lake lies near
Muir Highway
, north of
Walpole
and southeast of
Manjimup
.
Description
[
edit
]
The lake has a surface area of 46 square kilometres (18 sq mi). Lake Muir and its surrounding wetland lies within the Lake
Muir-Byenup System
, a 694 km
2
(268 sq mi) area of internal drainage containing a complex of wetland systems. It is fed by a stream leading into the lake, which is crossed at the Lake Muir Bridge.

Lake Muir may, in flood, overflow southwest into the
Deep River
catchment (and possibly also southeast into the
Frankland River
via Poorginup Gully).
[

]
Lake Muir is usually brackish (1000–3000 mg/L
TDS
) at the end of winter, saline by summer and dry throughout autumn.

Lake Muir is protected within
Lake Muir Nature Reserve
, which was designated in 2001.

Flora and fauna
[
edit
]
A 14-square-kilometre (5.4 sq mi) section of wetland around Lake Muir has been identified by
BirdLife International
as an
Important Bird Area
(IBA) because it provides habitat for 10 or more pairs of
endangered
Australasian bitterns
. The wetlands within the IBA are shallow with extensive beds of dense sedgeland and fringing stands of shrubland and woodland. Lake Muir has been excluded from the IBA as it is unsuitable for bitterns but it has supported large numbers of
Australian Shelduck
and may prove to be globally significant for that species.

History
[
edit
]
The lake is connected with significant indigenous occupation over time.
[

]
Lake Muir was named after brothers Thomas and John Muir, the first European settlers in the Warren district, who settled at
Deeside
, 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of the lake, in 1852 and built a rush hut there in 1856.
[

Historically the area was a Game Reserve, with a
duck shooting
season
.  The
Department of Environment and Conservation
(CALM) started monitoring the wetlands system in 1980 in order to manage the duck shooting.
On 5 January 2001, a 106-square-kilometre (41 sq mi) area was designated, under the
Ramsar Convention
as Ramsar site 1050, a wetland of international importance, acknowledging its rich ecological diversity.
Lake Muir Nature Reserve
was designated in the same year by the Government of Western Australia.

A
magnitude
5.7 earthquake was centred at the lake on 16 September 2018
[

]
and was followed by a magnitude 4.7 quake on 13 October
[

]
and a 5.4 quake on 9 November.
