Choose a location: full sun or shade?
When creating a natural pond in Australia, one of the first considerations is whether to place it in a sunny or shaded area. This decision will impact the ecosystem that your pond supports, as well as the level of maintenance required.
Full sun is the best option for those who want a vibrant and diverse pond ecosystem. Sunlight promotes the growth of algae, which is the primary food source for many aquatic creatures, including fish and invertebrates. A sunny location also helps to keep the water warm, which is ideal for most pond life, including native Australian species such as tadpoles, dragonflies, and water beetles. However, excessive sunlight can also lead to a rapid overgrowth of algae, causing the water to become green and murky. This may require more frequent maintenance, such as algae removal and water treatments.
Shade is a better choice for those seeking a low-maintenance pond or wanting to create a specific habitat. By situating your pond in a shaded area, you can mimic the conditions of a forest pond, providing a unique environment for certain plants and animals. Many aquatic plants, such as lilies and iris, prefer partial shade, and their inclusion can help to create a naturalistic setting. However, too much shade can limit the amount of algae growth, reducing the available food source for some pond life. It's important to strike a balance, perhaps by choosing a location that receives morning sun and afternoon shade or vice versa.
The surrounding landscape and existing features can also guide your decision. For example, placing the pond near trees can provide shade, but falling leaves may contribute to debris and nutrient levels in the water, affecting water quality. Additionally, consider the direction of sunlight and its intensity at different times of the day and year. Understanding the sun's path will help you make an informed choice about the amount of sunlight or shade your pond will receive.
Ultimately, the decision between full sun and shade depends on your specific goals and preferences. If you desire a vibrant, ecologically diverse pond with abundant algae and warm water, opt for a sunny location. However, if you prefer a low-maintenance pond or wish to create a shaded habitat for specific plants and animals, then a partially shaded location may be more suitable. By taking into account the surrounding environment and the needs of the pond ecosystem, you can make an informed choice to ensure the long-term health and beauty of your natural pond.

Prepare the base and dig a hole
When preparing to build a natural pond, it's important to consider the location. Algae, for instance, thrives in sunny areas with warm water. However, a pond in the shade may be more enjoyable for you and will have less algae.
Now, let's get started on preparing the base and digging the hole for your natural pond:
First, gather the necessary tools and materials, including a shovel, trowel, garden hose, plank of wood, spirit level, pond liner, sand or liner underlay, newspaper, bricks, landscaping rocks, and a fountain pump (optional). Mark the area for your pond by using a garden hose as a guide to work out the approximate shape. Keep in mind that you want the sides to be straight down, but be careful not to break off parts of the wall as you dig.
Remove any crumbly topsoil to a width of 4-5 inches around the hole. You can use this topsoil later for planting around the edges of the pond. Use a straight plank of wood and a spirit level to ensure your sides are reasonably in line across the pond. Create a deep part and a shallow part to accommodate different types of plants and fish. The centre of the hole should be about 15cm deeper than the small area at the top. For example, the maximum depth specified by some pond kits is 60 centimetres.
Scrape the sides of the hole with a shovel to remove any loose rocks or debris that could puncture your liner. Use your hands to feel around all areas of the pond and remove any remaining small rocks with a trowel. Now, it's time to place the underlay in the hole. You can use sand, damp newspaper, carpet, or a special underlay purchased from a garden centre. An inch of sand in the bottom and on the ledge should be sufficient.
Lay the Liner
Lay the liner over the hole, being careful not to drag it around too much. Take your time to achieve a neat look. You can gently push the liner into the corners with your hands and do some initial pleating. Use black vinyl duct tape to secure any pleats and make them less noticeable. Finally, hold the liner down neatly all around the pond with bricks or stones.
Now that the base is prepared and the hole is dug, you can move on to the next steps of building your natural pond, such as adding rocks, creating a waterfall or stream, and choosing the right plants and equipment to maintain water quality.

Line the pond with sand and underlay
When creating a pond, it is essential to consider the application of sand as the first or base level of underlay for the pond liner. Sand can help to level off any large discrepancies in the ground and fill up gaps caused by rocks or uneven surfaces. It also aids in drainage if your pond is built on boggy ground.
However, it is important to note that sand settles over time and can disguise sharp objects that may cause problems later on. Sand is also unsuitable for the sides of the pond, as it will simply fall to the bottom. Therefore, it is recommended to use sand in conjunction with a geotextile pond liner underlay sheet. Before laying the sand, ensure that there are no sharp objects, such as rocks or roots, that could puncture the liner.
One method to prevent sand from being sucked into the pond's drainage holes is to install rows of pipework with holes, bury them in sand, and then use a fabric underlayment and liner. This combination of pipework, underlayment, and liner helps to distribute water evenly throughout the sand and prevents the sand from being sucked into the drainage holes.
It is also important to choose the right type of sand for your pond. Test different types of sand by placing them in a bottle of water to ensure they have the desired properties. Look for sand that will not wash away and consider using brickie's sand, which is specifically designed to withstand water and provide a stable base for your pond liner.

Add a pond liner and pump
Adding a pond liner and pump is an essential step in creating a natural pond in Australia. Firstly, consider the size and nature of your pond. If you have trees close by, you may want to consider a thicker liner, such as the Firestone EPDM pond liner, which comes with a 20-year guarantee and superior durability. This liner is 1.02mm thick and can be cut to size, making it ideal for larger ponds. Alternatively, for a small pond, a PVC pond liner is a more budget-friendly option, with a thickness of 0.5mm.
Once you have selected the appropriate liner, it is important to prepare the ground. Spread a layer of sand, around 2-3cm, over the bottom of the pond to create a soft cushion that will protect the liner from any rocks. This is especially important if you are lining a hole in the ground.
Now, it's time to select a pump. The right pump for your pond will depend on various factors, including the size and shape of your pond and whether you want to create a stream or waterfall. As a general rule, you should choose a pump that can turn the water over at least once every hour. For example, a 2500-litre pond would require a pump with a minimum capacity of 2500 litres per hour. It is recommended to select a submersible pond pump, specifically designed to be completely submerged, with dry mode protection, which automatically turns the pump off if it runs dry.
If your pond has an irregular shape, you may need to incorporate jets or aerators to improve circulation and push water out of stagnant zones. Small solar pumps can be placed directly into these areas to direct the flow towards the skimmer. Additionally, you can oversize the main pump and use extra hose and diverter valves to push water from the sides of the pond towards the skimmer, ensuring good pond circulation, which is crucial for low-maintenance ponds.
By following these steps and choosing the appropriate liner and pump, you can ensure the structural integrity and functionality of your natural pond in Australia.

Incorporate rocks, logs, and plants
Incorporating rocks, logs, and plants is a great way to create a naturalistic environment for your pond. Here are some ways you can do this:
Rocks
Rocks can be used to create a natural-looking waterfall or stream, adding to the overall aesthetics of your pond. They can also provide hiding places for fish and other aquatic creatures. When selecting rocks, consider their size and shape to ensure they fit well within your pond design.
Logs
Logs, such as tree fern logs, can serve both functional and aesthetic purposes. They can help prevent the collapse of pond edges or ledges into the pond by providing support. Additionally, logs can offer a natural anchor for the roots of your water plants, allowing them to grow down into them. Over time, the logs will be covered by the growing roots, creating a harmonious natural environment.
Plants
When choosing plants for your pond, opt for native Australian species that can thrive in the local climate. You can select from two basic types of pond plants: submersibles and marginals. Submersible plants need to be completely submerged and are placed on deeper ledges. Marginals, on the other hand, grow in the boggy mud around the edge of the pond and prefer moist soil without being fully submerged. Some interesting plant options include the North American Skunk Cabbage, watercress, and Vietnamese mint.
In addition to their aesthetic value, plants can also serve a functional purpose in your pond. Aquatic plants like Brahmi can help with natural filtration by absorbing excess nutrients and oxygenating the water. They can also reduce the need for chemical treatments by helping to maintain water quality and health.

Frequently asked questions
What are the first steps to building a natural pond in Australia?
First, you need to dig a hole. Mark out the shape with a garden hose and dig straight down, being careful not to break off parts of the wall. You'll want to create a deep part and a shallow part—the centre of the hole should be deeper to allow for a range of plants.
What should I do once the hole is dug?
Check for rocks and roots that may puncture the liner. Then, place an underlay in the hole—you can use sand, damp newspaper, carpet, or a special underlay. Next, lay the pond liner over the hole, draping it gently into the corners. You can use duct tape to tape down pleats and bricks or stones to hold the liner down neatly.
What should I do once the liner is in place?
You can use cement to secure the liner in place. Pack dirt up to the liner like a ramp, then fold the liner down and pack dirt over the top. This will prevent runoff from flowing into the pond.
What plants and animals can I add to my pond?
Choose plants that are native to your area and can thrive in the local climate. Marginal plants like moist soil but don't like to be really wet, so plant these at the pond edge. Submersible plants need to be planted on deeper ledges and be completely submerged. You can also add fish to your pond, but it's important to do so slowly—allow 6-8 weeks for the pond to find a natural balance and add 2-3 fish at a time.
