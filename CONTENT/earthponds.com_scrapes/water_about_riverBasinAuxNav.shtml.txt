Topographic Drainage Divisions and River Regions
Topographic Drainage Divisions and River Regions derived from the Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric
Topographic Drainage Divisions and River Regions are derived from the Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (the Geofabric).
Providing a set of surface water reporting units based on drainage-enforced digital elevation models, they are used to depict where water flows and drains across the landscape.
Topographic Drainage Divisions and River Regions updates boundaries based on current research, data and technology. It references previous work of the Australian Water Resources Management Committee as shown in Australia's River Basins 1997. The divisions and regions exist within the Geofabric's Hydrology Reporting Regions with data available for
download
.
This work is a collaboration of scientists from the Bureau of Meteorology, Australian National University Fenner School of Environment and Society, CSIRO Water for Healthy Country Flagship and Geoscience Australia.

Australia's River Basins 1997
Australian Drainage Divisions and River Basin boundaries, derived from Geoscience Australia data
The Australia's River Basins 1997 project was a joint State, Territory and Australian Government initiative to create a national spatial database of major hydrological basins. It shows Australia's basin boundaries as defined by the Australian Water Resources Management Committee.
The Australian continent is divided into drainage divisions that are sub-divided into water regions and then into river basins. The data includes the name and number of each of the 245 basins, 77 regions, and 12 divisions. The custodian of this
data
is Geoscience Australia.
