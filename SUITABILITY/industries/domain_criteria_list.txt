Current Domain Analysis Criteria:

1. Food Items
   - Identifies domains containing food-related keywords
   - Helps filter out domains that might be related to food businesses or recipes

2. Industries
   - Identifies domains containing industry-specific keywords
   - Examples include: plumbing, gaming, construction, technology, etc.
   - Helps identify domains that might be too specific to certain business sectors

Note: This list will be updated as new criteria are added to the domain analysis system.
